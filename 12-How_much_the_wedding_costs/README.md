# `12` How Much Does the Wedding Cost?

Here is a table of prices of a wedding catering company:

| Nº of people | Price |
|:---|---:|
| Up to 50 people  | $4,000 |
| Up to 100 people | $10,000 |
| Up to 200 people | $15,000  |
| More than 200 people | $20,000 |

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function `getPrice` that receives the number of guests attending the wedding and returns the corresponding `price` on the console.

## 📎 Example:

For example, if the user says that **20 people** are attending the wedding, the returned price should be **4000**.

## 💡 Hints:

+ Use a conditional `if...else` statement to divide your code and assign the variable `price` to the appropriate value.

+ Divide and Conquer: breaking a problem up into smaller pieces that are easier to solve.
