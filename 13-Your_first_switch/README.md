# `13` Your First Switch Statement

We can use another form of conditional called a **switch statement**. A switch statement evaluates an expression and matches it to a `case` clause, executing the statements therein. Here is a basic example:

```js
const expr = 'One';
switch (expr) {
    case 'One':
        console.log('1');
        break;
    case 'Zero':
        console.log('0');
        break;
    default:
        console.log('Does not compute.');    
}
```

Imagine that your software is running the inventory of a shoe store. The client needs to know what colors a particular shoe is available in.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Complete the `switch` statement with 3 cases for a shoe coming in the following colors: `red`, `green` and `blue`.

2. The function needs to return `true` if the user input matches one of the cases listed in the switch statement, `false` otherwise.
