# `16` Your First Loop

Loops and iterations allow you to repeat a process quickly and efficiently. The two most commonly used forms are `for` and `while` loops. 

1. `for` loops look like this:

```js
for (initialExpression; conditional; incrementalExpression) {
    ...statements;
}
```

Here is an example `for` statement:

```js
// a "for" loop
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log("Hello!")
}
```

2. `while` loops are similar in nature. They look like this:

```js
initialExpression;
while (conditional) {
    ...statements;
    incrementalExpression;
}
```

And here is an example:

```js
// a "while" loop
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
    i++;
}
```

As long as the *conditional* is true, the loop will continue to repeat. If the *conditional* is false, the loop will exit. Notice how both types of loops use the same pieces, just organized in a different manner.

You can use `>` (greater than), `<` (less than), `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<=` (less than or equal to), `===` (equal to), `!==` (not equal to) in your conditionals.

Running the current code will print the integers `0` through `99` to the console.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Change the code to print the integers `0` to `100`.
