# `11` Your First "If" Statement

Your journey has now reached a crucial point: **conditional statements**. **Conditionals** allow a user to navigate through a program based upon their inputs. This is the beginning of computer logic.

The current application has a prompt asking `How many km are left to go?`

## üìù Instructions:

Once the user inputs an amount, one of the following responses will be printed to the console:

1. If there are more than 100 km left to go, we answer: `"We still have a bit of driving left to go"`.

2. If there are more than 50 km, but less or equal to 100 km, we answer: `"We'll be there in 5 minutes"`.

3. If there are less than or equal to 50 km, we answer: `"I'm parking. I'll see you right now"`.

## üí° Hints:

+ Use an `if...else` statement to check the value of the `total` variable.

+ You can use `else if` within your conditional, if needed.

+ Print the corresponding message to the console.
