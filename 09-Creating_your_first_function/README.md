# `09` Creating Your First Function

To define a function, you have to understand its structure first. For example:

```js
function function_name (param1, param2, ...) {
    return param1 + param2;
}
```

+ Functions begin with the **keyword** `function`.

+ The `function_name` is the name of the function.

+ `(param1, param2, ...)` are the **parameters** (variables) required by the function. They can be integers, strings, decimals, or any combination thereof. You can have zero or more parameters in a given function.  Parameters are assigned **arguments**, which are the user's input.

+ The space within the curly brackets `{...}` is the function's body.  Here is where the arguments are processed and some sort of output is provided. 

+ The output can include returning a value (as shown in the example above), printing to the console, calling another function, etc.

+ The function `addNumbers()` is supposed to return the sum of two given numbers:

## üìù Instructions:

1. Complete the necessary code with the function body to make it behave as expected.

2. The exercise should print `7` to the console.

## üí° Hint:

- The function is receiving two arguments (stored in the parameters `a` and `b`). You can create a variable called `sum` within the function body that stores the total of both arguments.

## üîé Important:

+ There are exercises dedicated to functions. We encourage you to go and finish those after completing this exercise. Once you feel more comfortable with [functions](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-functions-exercises-tutorial), you should return here.
