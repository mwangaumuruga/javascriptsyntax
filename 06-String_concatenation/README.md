# `06` String Concatenation

One of JavaScript's strengths is generating HTML code. 

Concatenation comes in handy because you can create and add to existing HTML strings. To concatenate strings, we use the **+** (plus) operator. 

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Set the values for `myVar1`and `myVar2` so the code prints 'Hello World' to the console.

## Example:

```js
let one = 'a';
let two = 'b';
console.log(one+two); //this will print 'ab' on the console.
```
