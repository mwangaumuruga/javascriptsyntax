# `17` Creating a `for` loop

As we just learned, loops are useful to repeat a task quickly and efficiently using little code. As you continue on your journey as a developer, the `for` loop will become an indispensable tool.

Here again, is the structure of a `for` loop:

```js
for (initialExpression; conditional; incrementalExpression) {
    ...statements;
}
```
... and here is an example `for` statement:

```js
// a "for" loop
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log("Hello!")
}
```

Your teacher wants to make sure you understand that asking questions is important in your growth as a programmer. 

## 📝 Instructions:

1. He/She wants you to type `I will write questions if I'm stuck` 300 times to the console! Fortunately, you know a quick way to accomplish this - using a `for` loop!

2. Then, create a function called `standardsMaker()` that prints the phrase `I will write questions if I'm stuck` 300 times.
