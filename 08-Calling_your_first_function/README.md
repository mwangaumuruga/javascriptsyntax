# `08` Calling Your First Function

**Functions** are an amazing tool for programmers! 

Think of functions like black boxes  - you input something, you get something out. 

A function's strengths include, but are not limited to:

- Encapsulation of code from the rest of the program (hiding code). This is an important concept that you will learn more about as you grow as a developer.

- Reuse of code in different programs.  You can treat functions as tools in a toolbox.  This can make coding more efficient and clean.

- There is an already defined function `isOdd()` that returns `true` if an odd number is passed as an argument, and `false` if the argument is an even number.
 
## üìù Instructions:

1. Call the function `isOdd()` and pass the number 45345 as its argument.

2. Print the output of the function to the console.

## üîé Important: 

+ There are exercises dedicated to functions. We encourage you to go and finish those after completing this exercise. Once you feel more comfortable with [functions](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-functions-exercises-tutorial), return here and continue with these ones.
