# `23` Bottles of Milk 

Have you heard the song about 99 bottles of milk? It is a great song - not boring at all... 😆

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write an algorithm to print the exact same lyrics. You must use a `for` loop.

## 💻 Expected output:

```js
`99 bottles of milk on the wall, 99 bottles of milk.` 
`Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of milk on the wall.`

`98 bottles of milk on the wall, 98 bottles of milk.`
`Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of milk on the wall.`

...

`1 bottle of milk on the wall, 1 bottle of milk.`
`Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of milk on the wall.`

`No more bottles of milk on the wall, no more bottles of milk.` 
`Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of milk on the wall.`
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ The lyrics change slightly when there is one bottle left (singular instead of plural).

+ When there are no more bottles, the last verse changes to `Go to the store and buy some more`.
