# `21` Russian Roulette 

Have you ever played Russian Roulette? It's super fun! If you make it (wuuuahahahaha).

Revolvers can have 6 chambers for bullets. A single bullet is inserted into one of the chambers. The revolver chambers are spun to make the game random. Nobody knows the position of the bullet. FIRE!!!....... Are you dead?

## üìù Instructions:

The game is almost working.

1. The `fireGun()` function needs to be completed to make the game work. It should compare the bullet position against the chamber position.

## üí° Hints:

+ If the bullet position `firePosition` matches the chamber position given by the function `spinChamber`, the function `fireGun()` should return `You're dead!`.

+ If the bullet position `firePosition` doesn't match the chamber position given by the function `spinChamber`, the function `fireGun()` should return `Keep playing!`.

+ The function `spinChamber` returns a random number between 1 and 6.
