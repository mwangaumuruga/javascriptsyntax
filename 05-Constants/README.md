# `05` Constants


Since 2015, JavaScript has allowed the use of **constants**.

Constants differ from variables because once declared, they cannot have their values changed over time (unlike variables).

To declare a constant, you have to use the reserved word `const` instead of `var`, like this:

```js
const VERSION = '1.2';
```

Constants are extremely useful. As a developer you may want to make sure parts of your data are read-only.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Run the exercise and fix the error that is shown on the console.

2. Make the code output `0.9` on the console when fixed.

## 💡 Hint:

+ Search for "TypeError assignment to constant variable" on Google.com to learn how to fix it.
